<img width="400" alt="LRC_API-Tech_Stck" src="https://github.com/ctheil/professional-projects/assets/86980706/3c7a6397-74c8-48fd-accb-4c429fec730c">

## Overview

**The Backbone of LRC's Digital Transformation!**  🚀
The LRC API, developed using Express.js and TypeScript, began as the core for the DigiSign application but rapidly evolved to become the central hub 🌐 supporting all LRC technological solutions. It seamlessly integrates with MongoDB, ensuring robust data management and real-time updates across all connected platforms.
## Features
### Comprehensive Database Management 📊
- Seamlessly integrates with MongoDB, ensuring robust, scalable, and real-time data management across all LRC platforms.
### DigiSign Integration 📺
- Houses essential business logic to ensure the DigiSign application runs smoothly and efficiently.
- Manages authentication 🔐 for the DigiSign application, ensuring secure access and data integrity.
### Analytics Client Integration 📈
- Handles device verification, ensuring only authorized devices can access the platform.
- Manages and stores analytics, providing a comprehensive overview of user interactions and engagements.
### LRCo Integration 💻
- Serves as the core for fetching and managing recorded analytics via both HTTP and Socket connections.
- Manages device verification and viewing, ensuring secure and seamless integration with the LRCo platform.
- Implements a student sign-on system, allowing students to create their accounts. This system is built from scratch, including features like email verification 📧 (to ensure only students with a ucdenver email address can access services) and email notifications for session updates, changes, and cancellations.
- For staff profiles, the API generates blurhashes and preview thumbnails 🖼️ whenever a profile is uploaded. This ensures fast loading times across the LRCo website, the Apple TV app, and the Analytics Client.
## Dive Deeper 🌊

The LRC API is not just an API; it's the heart and soul ❤️ of the LRC's digital ecosystem. By providing a centralized solution for data management, authentication, and business logic, it ensures that all LRC platforms, from DigiSign to the Analytics Client, operate seamlessly, efficiently, and securely. The challenges faced during its development, from integrating multiple platforms to implementing custom authentication systems, highlight the depth of innovation and adaptability that went into crafting this state-of-the-art API.
